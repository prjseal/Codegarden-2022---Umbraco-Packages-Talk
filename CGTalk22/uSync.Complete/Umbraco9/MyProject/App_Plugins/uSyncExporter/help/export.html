<!-- create a sync pack help -->
<umb-pane>
    <p>A sync pack is the collection of configuration and files needed to recreate settings and content on an Umbraco installation</p>

    <h5>Pack Elements</h5>
    <p>
        you can select any number of elements to include in your sync pack
    </p>

    <h5>Include media files</h5>
    <p>
        Include the media files associated with any media items that are synced.
    </p>

    <h5>Include website files</h5>
    <p>
        Include all files required to display the site, (templates, css, scripts)
    </p>
    <p class="text-info">
        If you tick this box you get all files, regardless of what templates, or scripts you pick from the dashboard. If 
        you only want to include some files, you should use the pickers and leave this box unticked.
    </p>
    <h5>Include node config</h5>
    <p>
        Included the configuration associated with any content node, e.g Culture and Hostnames, or Public access settings.
    </p>

    <h5>Include linked items</h5>
    <p>
        Include all items that are linked to the items you have selected, e.g if you pick a single page all the pages linked
        to on that page via the content or content pickers, will be included in the export. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-info">
        Including items that are linked from other items, can result in large sync files, especially if it is
        also combined with other settings such as include children / ancestors as all items linked in those
        elsements will also be calculated.
    </p>
    <h5>Dependencies</h5>
    <p>
        Elements that are needed for any selected item, (e.g datatypes for a doctype)
    </p>
    <p>
        Including dependencies means the whole item can be recreated on another umbraco instance, you should only uncheck this option
        if you are sure the target umbraco installation has all the configuration needed to recreate an item.
    </p>
    <h5>Children</h5>
    <p>Any elements that live below this element within the tree</p>
    <h5>Ancestors</h5>
    <p>The parent elments for an item, including these will build the tree when you import into a new instance</p>
